# Console-Finances

## Java script code for analysing the financial records of a company.

## Description 

What I have done in this project:

- Written JavaScript code that calculates the following:
    - Total number of months in the dataset
    - Net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period of the dataset
    - Average of changes in profit/losses between each month in the period
    - Greatest increase in profit/losses over the period
    - Greatest decrease in profit/losses over the period

In order so that:

- The console log on my deployed application will present a financial analysis of the given dataset that satisfies the assessment criteria given to me.

This challenge was an exciting way to show off what I've learnt so far in this bootcamp in the javascript modules as well as outside research that I have completed to assist me in this project, and an opportunity to work with other students to trouble shoot issues that we were having, and learning how to work through those problems together. I particularly enjoyed finding a vast amount of methods that were used by my peers and I that achieved the same outcome in the console log. This has shown me how different our brains work as web developers and yet we can have the same result at the end of the day.

## Credits

Study groups with Davou Jobbi, Andrea Fontana, Thomas Jack, Lauren Eaton, Mirian Tomani held to help understand, troubleshoot and debug each others code.

Research on websites including W3Schools, MDN web docs and FreeCodeCamp viewing samples of code to help understand the basic concepts of javascript.

## Features

This is a collection of javascript code that uses for loops, if statements, functions and objects to analyse a given set of financial data, being displayed using console.log commands to show the total number of months, total change, average change, greatest increase and greatest decrease of profits/losses in the data set.
